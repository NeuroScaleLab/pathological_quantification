# Digital pathology quantification scripts for various immunohistochemical stainings

This repository contains several scripts to perform QuPath digital pathological qantification of immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings:
- Alphasynuclein (pSer129) with EP1536Y antibody (Abcam)
- - Lewy bodies (count) and remaining alpha-synuclein pathology (% area) in the substantia nigra
- - Lewy Bodies (count) and remaining alpha-synuclein pathology (% area) in the cortex
- Amyloid-beta with 4G8 antibody (Biolegends)
- Neurofilament light (NfL) immunoreactivity with NfL antibody (synaptic systems)
- Hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) with AT8 antibody (ThermoFisher)
- Phosphorylated neurofilament medium and heavy chain immunoreactivity with SMI312 (Biolegend)
- Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neuron (count) and threads (% area) with TH antibody (Immunostar)


Each script contains more information on e.g. QuPath version and the publication in which a script is used.

All required files are within each folder.
